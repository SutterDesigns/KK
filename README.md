First rule of thumb: Create your HTML format of the page.
<!DOCTYPE html> ( This goes prior to your HTML code) 
<html>
<head> ( this will make your font large)
  <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

The content of the document......

</body>
</html> ( this is how you end your HTML code)
Try it Yourself Â»
<B> is bold you end it with </b>

Now what is italics?

Okay once you make "rabbit" in italics I would like you to create
A list of species that can hop.
